1.Problem Statement:  
Create a Java program that demonstrates the concept of
multi-threading and synchronization. Implement a shared
BankAccount class where multiple threads (representing different
users) try to withdraw money concurrently. Use synchronization to
ensure that the account balance does not become inconsistent.------THREADS ASSIGNMENT------
Ans.
import java.util.Scanner;
class BankAccount {
    private int balance;
    public BankAccount(int balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }
    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            System.out.println("Withdrawal of " + amount + " successful.");
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Remaining balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance for withdrawal of " + amount);
        }
    }
}
class UserThread extends Thread {
    private BankAccount account;
    private int amount;
    public UserThread(BankAccount account, int amount) {
        this.account = account;
        this.amount = amount;
    }
    public void run() {
        account.withdraw(amount);
    }
}
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter Initial Balance: ");
        int initialBalance = sc.nextInt();
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(initialBalance);
        System.out.print("Enter number of withdrawals: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        UserThread[] threads = new UserThread[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter withdrawal amount: ");
            int amount = sc.nextInt();
            threads[i] = new UserThread(account, amount);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            threads[i].start();
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
